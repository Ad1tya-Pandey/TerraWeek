# TerraWeek Day-05

## Understanding Terraform modules:
-> Terraform modules are like ready-made templates that you can reuse to create and manage infrastructure components. They encapsulate a set of resources and configurations, allowing you to easily deploy and manage common infrastructure patterns.

-> Think of modules as building blocks or blueprints that you can use to create consistent and repeatable infrastructure. Just like using a pre-designed template for a website or a document, Terraform modules provide a way to reuse and share infrastructure configurations, making it easier to manage and scale your infrastructure.

-> By using modules, you can avoid reinventing the wheel and benefit from best practices and proven configurations. Modules promote code reuse, reduce duplication, and make your infrastructure code more organized and modular.

- In simple terms, Terraform modules are like reusable templates that help you build infrastructure faster and maintain consistency across your projects.
