# Learnings of Day 1 of TerraWeek

## 1) What is Terraform and how can it help you manage infrastructure as code
 
 - Terraform is a Infrastructure as Code tool which helps us in  managing the creation of infrastructure in a automated way rather than the old-school way of doing it manually. 
 - Since we don't have to manually create the infrastructure ourseleves if we use terraform we can save our time and such other valuable resources , also the language used to create terraform files ( HCL ) is easy to understand and human readable so the process gets quite easier.

## 2) Why do we need Terraform and how does it simplify infrastructure provisioning?

 - Terraform simplifies infrastructure provisioning through Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
 - It allows us to define infrastructure resources using code, making configuration human-readable and version-controlled.
 - Terraform's declarative language specifies the desired state of infrastructure, abstracting away low-level configurations and commands.
 - Automation and consistency are achieved by automating infrastructure provisioning and replicating configurations across environments.
 - Terraform provides dependency management and resource ordering capabilities for orchestration.
 - It supports multiple cloud providers and hybrid cloud environments.
 - The plan and apply workflow helps preview and apply infrastructure changes.

## 3) How can you install Terraform and set up the environment for AWS, Azure, or GCP?
  
 - I installed it on a AWS EC2 isntance with UBUNTU OS running on it using the following steps 
 - `wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform*`

## 4) Explain the important terminologies of Terraform with the example at least (5 crucial terminologies).
 
 ### - Provider: A provider is responsible for managing and interacting with a specific infrastructure platform, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. It allows Terraform to provision resources on that platform.

 ### - Resource: A resource represents a specific infrastructure component that you want to manage. It could be an EC2 instance, a VPC, or a DNS record.
 
 ### - Module: A module is a reusable set of Terraform configurations that represents a specific piece of infrastructure or functionality. It allows you to encapsulate and reuse configurations across projects. 
 
 ### - Variable: A variable is a placeholder for values that can be used within Terraform configurations. It allows you to make your configurations more flexible and reusable.
 
 ### - Output: An output defines values that are generated by your Terraform configuration and can be useful for displaying information or passing values between modules. 

  

### 1. Provider
`provider "aws" {
  access_key = "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY"
  secret_key = "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_KEY"
  region     = "us-west-2"
}`
### 2. Resource
`resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c94855ba95c71c99"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}`
### 3. Variable
`variable "instance_count" {
  type    = number
  default = 1
}`
### 4. Output
`output "instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.example.id
}`
### 5. Module
`module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "3.3.0"

  name = "my-vpc"
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
}`
